Implements robust median-based Bayesian growth curve models that handle
Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR), and
Missing Not At Random (MNAR) missing-data mechanisms, and allow
auxiliary variables. Models are fitted via 'rjags' (interface to 'JAGS')
and summarized with 'coda'.
