Description: Implements robust median-based Bayesian growth curve models
    that handle Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR),
    and Missing Not At Random (MNAR) missing-data mechanisms, and allow
    auxiliary variables. Models are fitted via 'rjags' (interface to 'JAGS')
    and summarized with 'coda'.
